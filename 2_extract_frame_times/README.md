Issues related to:
.mov and .AVI
basename shell command
SLURM output 

also: when parsing files, m is None and has no attribute group

data folder not included because its really large (9.9G). contains all the show_frames stuff

data/raw_output contains show_frames output
data/parsed contains csvs for each video

TODO generalize to samcam and alicecam
